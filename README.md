This application gives 4j School District employees a convenient way to fill in mileage expense reports without manually calculating the distance between school buildings. It was created by the Mentor Team.

### Features
 - Uses [pre-computed distances between school buildings](https://github.com/inductivekickback/mileage/)
 - A vanilla copy of the expense report PDF is bundled with the application and a new PDF is created every time it's filled in -- this precludes annoying errors that can happen when the same PDF is edited multiple times.
 - Auto-complete is enabled for school and purpose columns

### Requirements
Tested on macOS Big Sur and newer (Intel and Apple silicon).
