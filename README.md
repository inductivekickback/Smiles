This application gives 4j School District employees a convenient way to fill in mileage expense reports without [manually calculating distances between school buildings](https://github.com/inductivekickback/mileage).

### Features
 - A vanilla copy of the expense report PDF is bundled with the application and a copy is created every time it's ready to be submitted -- this precludes annoying errors that can happen when the same PDF is edited multiple times.
 - Auto-complete is enabled for school and purpose columns
